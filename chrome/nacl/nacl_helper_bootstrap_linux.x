 * This is a custom linker script used to build nacl_helper_bootstrap.
 * It has a very special layout.  This script will only work with input
 * that is kept extremely minimal.  If there are unexpected input sections
 * not named here, the result will not be correct.
 *
 * We need to use a standalone loader program rather than just using a
 * dynamically-linked program here because its entire address space will be
 * taken over for the NaCl untrusted address space.  A normal program would
 * cause dynamic linker data structures to point to its .dynamic section,
 * which is no longer available after startup.
 *
 * We need this special layout (and the nacl_helper_bootstrap_munge_phdr
 * step) because simply having bss space large enough to reserve the
 * address space would cause the kernel loader to think we're using that
 * much anonymous memory and refuse to execute the program on a machine
 * with not much memory available.
