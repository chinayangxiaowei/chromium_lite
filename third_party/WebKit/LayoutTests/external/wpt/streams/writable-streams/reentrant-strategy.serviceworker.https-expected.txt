This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Service worker test setup 
PASS writes should be written in the standard order 
PASS writer.write() promises should resolve in the standard order 
PASS controller.error() should work when called from within strategy.size() 
FAIL close() should work when called from within strategy.size() assert_array_equals: sink.write() should not be called lengths differ, expected 1 got 0
PASS abort() should work when called from within strategy.size() 
PASS releaseLock() should abort the write() when called within strategy.size() 
FAIL original reader should error when new reader is created within strategy.size() assert_array_equals: close must always be called with the controller lengths differ, expected 1 got 0
Harness: the test ran to completion.
