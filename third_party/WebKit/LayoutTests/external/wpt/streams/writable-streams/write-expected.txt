This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS WritableStream should complete asynchronous writes before close resolves 
FAIL WritableStream should complete synchronous writes before close resolves assert_array_equals: close must always be called with the controller lengths differ, expected 1 got 0
PASS fulfillment value of ws.write() call should be undefined even if the underlying sink returns a non-undefined value 
PASS WritableStream should transition to waiting until write is acknowledged 
PASS when write returns a rejected promise, queued writes and close should be cleared 
PASS when sink's write throws an error, the stream should become errored and the promise should reject 
PASS writer.write(), ready and closed reject with the error passed to controller.error() made before sink.write rejection 
PASS a large queue of writes should be processed completely 
PASS WritableStreamDefaultWriter should work when manually constructed 
PASS returning a thenable from write() should work 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
