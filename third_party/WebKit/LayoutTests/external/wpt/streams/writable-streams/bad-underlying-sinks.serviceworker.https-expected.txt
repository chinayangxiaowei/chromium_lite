PASS close: throwing getter should cause writer close() to reject 
PASS write: throwing getter should cause write() and closed to reject 
PASS write: throwing method should cause write() and closed to reject

PASS write: returning a rejected promise (second write) should cause writer write() and ready to reject 
PASS abort: non-function abort method with .apply
